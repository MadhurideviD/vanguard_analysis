# 📠 **VANGUARD ANALYSIS**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes client interaction data from Vanguard to evaluate the impact of a redesigned digital experience. Vanguard hypothesized that a more modern and intuitive User Interface (UI)—enhanced with in-context prompts (such as cues, messages, hints, and task-specific instructions)—would improve the overall user journey. The primary objective was to determine whether these UI enhancements led to a higher rate of process completion among clients.

## 📂 **Datasets Used**
1. Client Profiles (df_final_demo)
2. Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data)
3. Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients)
